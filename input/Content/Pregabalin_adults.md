### Pregabalin adult PBPK model

Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug used for neuropathic pain, epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder. It is only administered orally. It is reported with 90-99% of the dose fraction extreted unchanged into urine via GFR. [1] As reported by Zhou et al [1] pregabalin undergoes active tubular reabsorption via a transporters of which the ontogeny is unknown. Our final pregabalin model was built that applies only GFR mediated clearance that adequately described the pharmacokinetics in adults without further need of an active process. 

The pregabalin model was developed using data of the following publications:
