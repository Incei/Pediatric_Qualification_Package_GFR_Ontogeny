### Pregabalin model

Pregabalin PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Mann D, Liu J, Chew ML, Bockbrader H, Alvey CW, Zegarac E, Pellock J, Pitman VW. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of pregabalin in children with refractory partial seizures: a phase 1, randomized controlled study. Epilepsia. 2014 Dec;55(12):1934-43. doi: 10.1111/epi.12830. Epub 2014 Nov 6.

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the clearance values of pregabalin observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 7.2 months to 15.7 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed clearance values are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed clearance ratio plot, showing that all predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values.
